8.	Study of Techniques uses for Web Based Password Capturing. 
Password cracking typically refers to the process of recovering scrambled passwords. It can be used to help a user get back a forgotten password or to help a system administrator  to check for weak passwords. But more often, password cracking is used y bad actors to gain unauthorized access to systems and resources.
Password cracking generally falls into two categories:
1.	Password guessing
2.	Password cracking.

Types of Passwords
1.	System Password (Windows password, Android lock, Bypass)
2.	Browser password(Browser all store passwords)
3.	Application password(app password, file password, etc)
4.	Wifi password

Attacks
1.	Brute Force attack
2.	Dictionary Attack
3.	Rainbow Table
4.	Credential Stuffing attack
5.	Hybrid attack
6.	Key loggers
7.	Phishing attacks

Tools in kali linux
1.	Hashcat
2.	John the Ripper
3.	Crunch
4.	Hydra
5.	Cewl

Steps for password Cracking

1.	 Now open Kali Linux and metasploitable machine.
2.	Now go Applications and scroll to password attacks. By selecting the password attacks, You can view all types of password attacks supported by KL.
3.	Now we will use hydra tool. Type the command to learn about hydra tool.
>>hydra 
4.	Open metasploitable tool, user name – msfadmin, password- msfadmin. Get IP address of metasploitable m/c by typing ifconfig.
5.	Our metasploitable m/c address is 19 2.168.56.101.
6.	Now go to Kali Linux, create a password (text file) in the desktop and type the following command
$hydra –l msfadmin –P Desktop/text.txt ftp://192.168.56.101
Next we will crack a zip file’s password 
1.	Create a text file in the desktop by right-click on desktop and select create documentempty File. 
2.	Give the filename as sample-file.txt
3.	In the terminal go to Desktop and create password protected zip file as follows.
4.	$zip sample-zip –P abc sample.txt 
5.	Type ls to view the files in the desktop. It should display the password protected zip file in the list.
6.	Create hash file as follows.
7.	$zip2john sample-zip.zip > hash1.txt
8.	It will create the hash1.txt in the desktop. We can display using cat command.
9.	With $sudo hash1.txt, we get sample.zip/sample.txt:$pkzip$1*2*2*0*1e*12*d4313f2b*0*44*0*1e*710b*c522094babf4491ef59fe9ebb3d:$pkzip$ sample.txt/sample.zip::sample.zip
10.	Open hash1.txt in nano editor and delete the contents from start and end till $.
11.	The final contents will be 
12.	$pkzip$1*2*2*0*1e*12*d4313f2b*0*44*0*1e*710b*c522094babf4491ef59fe9ebb3d:$pkzip$
13.	From here we see that it is using pkzip mode to archive.
14.	Now check the mode number with 
15.	$hashcat -help
16.	For pkzip we get
17.	17220 | PKZIP (Compressed Multi-File)                              | Archive
  17200 | PKZIP (Compressed)                                         | Archive
  17225 | PKZIP (Mixed Multi-File)                                   | Archive
  17230 | PKZIP (Mixed Multi-File Checksum-Only)                     | Archive
  17210 | PKZIP (Uncompressed)                                       | Archive
  20500 | PKZIP Master Key                                           | Archive
  20510 | PKZIP Master Key (6 byte optimization)                     | Archive

18.	Now we can crack the pwd with hashcat command. Type the hashcat command as follows. Here text in the command  in the password file. Or we can also use rockyou.txt file
$hashcat –a 0 –m  17210 hash1.txt passlist.txt
19.	-m is the mode in which password protected archived file is created.
20.	-a is the attack mode
21.	 [ Attack Modes ] -

  # | Mode
 ===+======
  0 | Straight
  1 | Combination
  3 | Brute-force
  6 | Hybrid Wordlist + Mask
  7 | Hybrid Mask + Wordlist
  9 | Association

22.	$hashcat -h for more details.
For zip files – 13600, 7-zip – 11600 and so on. We can check the mode by analysing the hash.txt file.
23.	It will give the password after $ sign in the output.
24.	We can create the archive files directly from the desktop. Right click on the file and select archive option and select the type of the archive file by clicking on the dropdown list.
25.	For 7zip we need some john-the-ripper packages. To get those type github john the ripper github in google. Go to the site and copy the link by clicking code.
26.	Create a file sample.txt and add some contents.
27.	Right click on the file – select ‘compress 1 file’ option. 
28.	Give the filename as sample.txt.7z and select the extension as 7z.
29.	Select encrypt option and give the password.
30.	Here the encrypted .7z file is generated.
31.	Go to Terminal in Desktop, clone the john-the-ripper packages as follows
32.	$git clone “https://github.com/opewall/john.git” -b bleeding-jumbo john
33.	The above will install john-the-ripper packages in john folder in desktop.
34.	Go to /john/run
35.	$ls
36.	$chmod +x 7z2john.pl
37.	$./7z2john.pl /home/geet/Desktop/sample.txt.7z>/home/geet/Desktop/hash3.txt
38.	It will create hashfile in Desktop. Open it in nano or text editor and delete till $ from beginning and type the following command in Desktop folder.
39.	$hashcat -a 0 -m 11600 hash3.txt passlist.txt

40.	In the terminal, in the /desktop
41.	Navigate
